<p>I started to learn informatics in third grade. It was so interesting and when I participated in my first competition in informatics. When I saw my result, I was so happy.</p>

<p>But when I took part in my first nactional competition, I was confident. After competition I was sure that I would have 300 of the 300 points. I told my solution of first task to my teacher (Iashu) and he started laughing. He attempt to try to deceive me that I would not have max (although he knew that I would have a 300 as he had seen ranking). I was worried.</p>

<p>When the ranking was published, I was over the moon with joy. Next day, it had closing ceremony and when I came out to reward me, I was so happy, because I and 2 more boys were winners, but I was one year younger than them.</p>

<p>This day is important for me, because it laid the foundation of my development in the informatics. Noow I have no day without coding something (even something small) and when I am tired, coding help me to "recharge" myself.</p>

<p>Yes, I become furious when my program does not work, but when it works, I am glad.</p>

<p>P.S.: Each programmer has 2 states - "Why doesn't my program work?" and "Why does my program work?" :D</p>

<p>The Internet cat be a dangerous place for young people, but it can be a useful place too.</p>

<p>The main idea of the Internet in the beginning was to improve communication between people. At first sight it sounds useful and clean ...</p>

<p>But like all good things created by humans and the Internet has become a convenient and easy way to manipulate and speculate. For example, some people create fake websites with false information (recently it happened with the website of the Ministry of Health). Or another example: most radicalised people join terrorist groups after being manipulated by pages in the Internet.</p>

<p>From this perspective, the Internet is a dangerous place for young people (and generally for people who can not distinguish truth from falsehood).</p>

<p>But if you are teenager and you are afraid to ask your parents for something, why don't you check it on the Internet. I tell again: the Internet is a dangerous place for people who can not distinguish truth from falsehood.</p>

<p>So Internet can be dangerous place and the most dangerous webpages must be forbidden! All webpages connected with religions too, because they are potentially dangerous.</p>
